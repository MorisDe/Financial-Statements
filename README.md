The File here consist of Financial Statements of Major Companies(2009-2023)
I have created a basic visualization and EDA on the Dataset
Using Pycaret I have predicted the Gross Profit of the given Comapanies in the dataset
Using the Library ydata_profiling I have created an indepth report of EDA Analysis of the Data Set
Incase Pycaret isnt working use the code pip install pycaret[full] this should install pycaret
The code SNS.pairplot takes time to excute this can be skipped
Final Visualization shows how closely the Lasso model predicted to the actual value
