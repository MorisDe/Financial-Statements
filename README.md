The File here consists of Financial Statements of Major Companies(2009-2023).

I have created a basic visualization and EDA on the Dataset.

Using Pycaret I have predicted the Gross Profit of the given companies in the dataset

Using the Library ydata_profiling I have created an in-depth report of EDA Analysis of the Data Set

In case Pycaret isn't working use the code pip install pycaret[full] this should install Pycaret

The code SNS.pairplot takes time to execute this can be skipped

The final Visualization shows how closely the Lasso model predicted the actual value
